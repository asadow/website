The bear is sullen and sits smoking a pipe with his top hat secured on its head. He sits in a human-like fashion. Louis is startled. He looks across and ushers a little meow. The large spirit bear turns his burly head, coughs, and exclaims,

“You must be a newly wild animal, else you would not be so startled and timid. You see, being domesticated put a spell on you, narrowed your vision to be like theirs, seeing only the material world and nothing else. But the wild animals see spirits. You may not believe me, you may think that wild animals are so desperate and despondent that they hallucinate, but believe what you will, for whether I am real or not outside of your perception is of little importance. You are here and I am here, and we are all together,” said the laughing spirit bear.

“Quite simply, your mind has perceived or conceived me and now I am to be dealt with. One method would be to speak to me in the language of this city. You are able to, now that you have escaped the spell of conformation. But don’t feel guilt at your having not known, young cat. I have spoken to many others who were once domesticated and I understand how most domesticated animals are so doted upon that their vocabulary need not extend past moans, groans, whimpers, barks, growls, and hisses, for these vocalizations are enough to garner their caretaker’s attention and love. One song that resounds in this city exhorts that all you need is love, and I believe that the situation of most domesticated animals supports this exhortation. Most domesticated animals receive nigh absolute love, and as such have little or no will to learn through practice and exploration anything outside of their caretaker’s will. That is why only the animals rejected by their caretaker’s, however slightly, dare venture outside of their safe haven: what is thought to be home. Don’t get me wrong, cat. Pets are not the only animals that suffer such fate. Even caretakers are animals, oftentimes isolated through domestication and blinded by love. And only those humans who are unsatisfied with their domestication in their respective society and with their love or lack thereof, may escape, become truly wild, and perceive my incorporeal body.”
